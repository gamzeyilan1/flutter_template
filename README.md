## General Information
- This is a throughout template to get started with a Flutter Project.
- It provides the front end for an app on both IOS and Android.
- It consists of the business layer, the must-haves and the project structure. All you need to do is to integrate the design & enter the design.
- There are examples on how you can use the logic and the integrated tools smoothly.


## Technologies Used
- Hive
- Flutter Http Package
- FireBase Crashlytics 
- Provider
- Flutter Mobx
- Easy Localization
- Mobx Codegen
- Build Runner
- (Optional) Json to Dart Plugin


## Features
- The project structure is MVVM & Test Driven.
- Each function and each tool is explained with an example and comments everywhere.
- You can see examples on how to test things under the /test folder, initialized with an example and explained with comments.
- The scripts that need to be run are defined under /scripts folder, just run the command "sh /scripts/scriptName.sh" to run them.
- You can see what you're going to place where and how to implement & use them by simply reviewing the naming convention.

## Setup
 Simply run "flutter pub get" and you're ready to launch the project. In order to use FireBase Crashlytics make sure to set it up on the FireBase Console. Get the Build Runner running to use Mobx and run the "lang.sh" under scripts for any added words to translation files to generate key.


## Usage
 After setup simply run the project on your preferred IDE on a simulator or a test device. Then add the shared widgets to lib/core/components as shown in the examples. Make sure each Stateful Widget view inherits from the BaseState. I encourage you to use the whole structure as shown with atomic design and abstractions.


## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_ / _complete_ / _no longer being worked on_. If you are no longer working on it, provide reasons why.


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- The network layer can make use of the Mobx more.

To do:
- Update based on feedback
- Update dependencies each time you use the template and push the newer version here
- Check if there are better approaches & packages, check if the used tools are still relevant everytime you use the template
